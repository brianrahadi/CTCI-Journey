# ctci-journey

## What is this repository for?
I used this repository as a place where I store all my answers for CTCI. It is quite a popular book for learning technical interviews.

## Why do you create this repository?
I enjoy and want to be good at solving problems. Sharing my attempt to public will (1) make me more accountable and (2) a learning chance for me to articulate my works to others.

## How do you learn CTCI?
I will go through all the technical questions from the one I consider the easiest, thus the answer may not be in order of chapter and numbers. After solving it, I will use the unittest given on [here](https://github.com/brianrahadi/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python).

After solving a given problem, I will translate those codes to plain english, explain my solutions step-by-step, and finally explain the time and space complexity of the given solution. Basically, this is quite the same with a real technical interview (I hope so)!
